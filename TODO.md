# NEW TODO
 - Add GRAVITY and collision
 - Add overlay controller for crosshair
 - Make chunk meshes get deleted if they are too far away from the player (to save on vram)
  
 - Remake the billboard system to allow for more than just text (aka texture)
 - entity system (and maybe nextbot example idk)
 - multithreading???? (only need if frame time starts to go above 16ms)
